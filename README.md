# Things we need
- 3 micro rhythm games to be notated as the kinds of jokes at play
  - a sound for each games' notes to make
- the ability to generate the rhythm games based on a seed
- laying out the games in the godot scene
- how should score be kept?

## Inspriration

- Rhythm Heaven Fever

## Assets needed

- Slightly different click for the player sounds
- Big Lever
- Miss sound

## Next steps

- Animate robots with 3 states (Perfect, OK/Good, Miss)
- Bop it functionality (robots call out keys or shapes, shapes are responded to on the next beat)
  - Call out generates a Goal that is a tuple of a beat and a button
